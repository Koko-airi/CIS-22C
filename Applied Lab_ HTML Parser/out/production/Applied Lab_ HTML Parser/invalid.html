<h1>Does this page use valid HTML?</h1>
<p>This website is very simple, but it contains invalid HTML. It might look ok in your browser, but it might
  choke on a browser that is less tolerant of coding mistakes. Can you find the
  invalid HTML on this page? Try this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at the HTML source. See if you can identify the invalid HTML
  before running it through the W3C Validator. <b>Hint:
  There are two examples of invalid HTML on this page.</b>
  </li>
  <li>Run this page through the HTML Validator.
  Did you find the same mistakes that the Validator found?</li>
  <li>Correct the mistakes found by the Validator, save the file, and run it through the Validator again. </li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the page validates.</li>
</ul>
</body>
